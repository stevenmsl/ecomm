            - Extremely important is that the id canâ€™t be the same
              as one of the prefix used in the remotes section 
              in the webpack.config.js 
              "products@http://localhost:8081/remoteEntry.js",
              "cart@http://localhost:8082/remoteEntry.js",
            - so products and cart can't be used as the id of 
              the element
            - reason for this is that webpack will create
              global variables called products and cart
              to access the code it downloaded from remoteEntry
            - if you use them as ids of a HTNM element that 
              those global variables will be redefined as 
              a HTML element, and this will cause errors 
         -->
